Big Sean Song Censorizer


write the question your project seeks to find a solution for
How can Big Sean become more family friendly


write a paragraph describing your client, your client's problem, and the solution you plan to create with your project.
A problem with Big Sean and music in general is that it's made for a specific enviromental. Often my clients want to play music in the house or for their family members, but the song pertains to a club environment, or maybe they want to play a club song but it has to much lyrics about love. My solution is to make a website where the user is presented with things to censor based on the lyrics of the song, if they for example click on drugs then every song lyric mentioning drugs will be censored making it appropriate for environments were drug talk is not allowed.

Sep-Oct (month 0-1)
*Psuedo code the project
*Confirm with people that my playlist is legit
*Confirm that I have the list of things to censor correct


Oct-Nov (month 1-2)

*Start with a single song in the playlist, if I can get the censoring program for that correct; import other songs.
*Also, import the instrumentals
*work on the interface as well, like a picture of big sean and flashy background
