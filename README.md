Big Sean Song Censorizer


write the question your project seeks to find a solution for
How can Big Sean become more family friendly


write a paragraph describing your client, your client's problem, and the solution you plan to create with your project.
A problem with Big Sean and music in general is that it's made for a specific enviromental. Often my clients want to play music in the house or for their family members, but the song pertains to a club environment, or maybe they want to play a club song but it has to much lyrics about love. My solution is to make a website where the user is presented with things to censor based on the lyrics of the song, if they for example click on drugs then every song lyric mentioning drugs will be censored making it appropriate for environments were drug talk is not allowed.

Sep-Oct (month 0-1)
*Psuedo code the project
*Confirm with people that my playlist is legit
*Confirm that I have the list of things to censor by checking up with clients.


Oct-Nov (month 1-2)

*Start with a single song in the playlist, if I can get the censoring program for that correct; import other songs.
*Also, import the instrumentals
*work on the interface as well, like a picture of big sean and flashy background

Nov-Dec (month 2-1)

continue working on the censoring, I think ill first do the curse words
then things that are less common like drugs materialism,love etc.
Feedback feature on the website so I can get feedback from people online

Dec-Jan (month 3-4)
*Finish interface, add a bunch of filler stuff to make the website look more complete and professional.
*publish the website and spread word of it on twitter.com as well as instagram.com, tag Big sean and hopefully he sees it.
*Actually use the website in situations that the client shared they often find themselves in
 
Jan-Feb (month 4-5)
*Implement feedback, start working on DLC if I have time. If a person shares the website they get acess to another subsection *of the website with Kanye songs.

Feb-March (month 5-6)
*Install and send the link to clients, or just show them in person
