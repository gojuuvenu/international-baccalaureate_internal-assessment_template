# Big Sean Song Censorizer

How can Big Sean become more family friendly
A problem with Big Sean and music in general is that it's made for a specific enviromental. Often my clients want to play music in the house or for their family members, but the song pertains to a club environment, or maybe they want to play a club song but it has to much lyrics about love. My solution is to make a website where the user is presented with things to censor based on the lyrics of the song, if they for example click on drugs then every song lyric mentioning drugs will be censored making it appropriate for environments were drug talk is not allowed.

Sep-Oct (month 0-1)

*Psuedo code the project
*Confirm with people that my playlist is legit
*Confirm that I have the list of things to censor by checking up with clients.


Oct-Nov (month 1-2)

*Start with a single song in the playlist, if I can get the censoring program for that correct; import other songs.
*Also, import the instrumentals
*work on the interface as well, like a picture of big sean and flashy background

Nov-Dec (month 2-1)

* continue working on the censoring, I think ill first do the curse words
* then things that are less common like drugs materialism,love etc.
* Feedback feature on the website so I can get feedback from people online

Dec-Jan (month 3-4)
*Finish interface, add a bunch of filler stuff to make the website look more complete and professional.
*publish the website and spread word of it on twitter.com as well as instagram.com, tag Big sean and hopefully he sees it.
*Actually use the website in situations that the client shared they often find themselves in
 
Jan-Feb (month 4-5)
*Implement feedback, start working on DLC if I have time. If a person shares the website they get acess to another subsection *of the website with Kanye songs. (((might make a general website and the dlc be the big sean)))

Feb-March (month 5-6)
*Install and send the link to clients, or just show them in person


# Scenario 

My clients are a group of my friends that listen to music atleast once a day and have issues with playing it outloud. I've been told by some when they are at home certein lyrics may make them feel uncomfortable or get them in trouble when other people are home with them, I've been told that people only like listening to certein parts of songs and that many songs in their entirety are boring or not as good as the part, I've also heard that people may listen to a song just for the instrumental. The current alternative to these problems are searching for clean version of songs, though that may censor more or less than what the client wants, a person can also just search for the part of a song on youtube; however it is very  likely they won't find anything especially if it's not from a mainstream personality; Lastly a few clients will lower the volume or talk louder or something of that sort when an inapropriate lyric is about to appear and they are listening in front of people and they don't want to wear headphones. All of these ideas may work decently in the moment but on a larger scale, for my clients who have reported these cases to be reacurring they need something that caters more twords their needs. My proprosed product is a website and phone app with a select sample size of about 80 songs, after choosing the song there buttons displaying key words that a person can choose to isolate. If for example you click a button labeled (sexual content) any lyrics regarding sexual content will be skipped, censored, or muted (either just vocals or entire sound file); another button may be a subject they may not feel like listening too like suicide or money. This website will exist as a prototype or blueprint for somebody in the future to expand on this by introducing A.I, or manually including a much larger size of songs. For the time being however, there will be a section on the website/app where the person is able to request a song they want added to the database. My advisor is Saad Bensalim as he has always been there guididng me through computer programming, and since I figured he'd be helping me anyways I might as well give him the officiol title.

# Rationale

A website and mobile app will be built using html java and css for the website and for the app using (not sure what apps use). I will make full use of the sound library embedded in javascript, every other function will likely be created on the spot. It is neccesary to make an app because generally most people including my clients listen to music on their phone, it's fast easy and they have the option to put in headphones or walk around while the songs are playing rather than be forced to stay at a computer desk. It will also take the form of a website to help attract more traffic to the website that hopefully will translate into submitted feedback  as well as giving the client more options to stream their favorite songs from.


## sucess criteria

*input a minimum of 80 songs (unless the clients request a smaller amount)
*input all censorship buttons that the client may request
*succesfullly make a website and app
*include all desired features between me and the client

hmmmn

// specify each client (names)
ios> android
start in a javascript library such as math.js 
make a library that works functions similar to how p5js sound has built in functions" make a file using mathjs as a model
ex: "musicCensor.censor("lyrics, "oops")
actual ai? (using shazam/apple/google/siri api? etc)
revise scenario to write library
narrate who said each line of the interview (me:, client:, etcr)
lucien/saad/kevin interview
